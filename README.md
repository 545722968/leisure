The project is based on computer vision face expression recognition, which builds a CNN model by training face expression pictures, with an accuracy rate of up to 80%, and can accurately recognize common expressions such as happy, sad, normal, surprised, and angry.
Steps:
1. Prioritize running data_preprocessing files for data preprocessing.
2. Run CNN_model build the model.
3. Run the app to check the effect.
4. Run evaluate to view the evaluation results
